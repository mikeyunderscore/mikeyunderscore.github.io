# About Me
## My Interests
* I like building computers (when I can afford it)
* Gaming is fun but these new games blow
* I want to learn how to repair computer parts in the future
## Websites I Recommend
* [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) - This website is pivotal for me and because it's easy for me to find compatible PC parts.
* [greatoldgames](https://www.gog.com) - If you want to play some good old pc games then this is the place to go.
